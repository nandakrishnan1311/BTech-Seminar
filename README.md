## Text-Guided Image Manipulation via Generative Adversarial Network With Referring Image Segmentation-Based Guidance
This repository provides an overview and implementation details for the paper "Text-Guided Image Manipulation via Generative Adversarial Network With Referring Image Segmentation-Based Guidance". The method introduces a novel approach to image manipulation guided by text inputs while leveraging image segmentation for enhanced control.

### Key Features
- **Text-Guided Manipulation:** Modify specific regions of an image based on text descriptions.
- **Segmentation-Based Guidance:** Utilize referring image segmentation to localize manipulations precisely.
- **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN):** Employ GANs for high-quality image synthesis and manipulation.
